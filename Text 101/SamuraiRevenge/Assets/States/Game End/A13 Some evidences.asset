  storyText: 'As you take the thing up, you see a usual shuriken. But then you notice
    that there''s nothing usual about it. Even holding it makes your fingers feel
    pain. As you clean it off some dirt, you see that there''s symbol in the center
    of it. You don''t know what they mean, but it''s already obvious that this evidence
    will serve as the beginning of the tracking.


    You can:

    1: Play again,
    if you like.

    2: Enjoy the consideration.'
