  storyText: "You rush out of your house inside the camp. It's only morning and nobody's
    out. But you don't have time to think about it, your only thought is to close
    to the figure. During that, still without thinking, you're shouting for help
    and people start to wake up. The figure runs between small houses and suddenly
    very swiftly climbs on top of one of them. \r\n\r\nYou can:\r\n1: Climb and chase
    on roofs.\r\n2: Continue your way through streets."
