  storyText: 'You continue your chasing through alleys, while the figure keep leaping
    on roofs. But fortunately for you, leaps are big enough to slow down the figure,
    and roofs have only one direction. So as they end, you stand right below the
    figure. Now they have no other choice, but to jump down.


    You can:

    1:
    Wait till they be down and continue chasing.

    2: Try to knock off, while
    they are falling .'
