  storyText: 'You decide to go up on roofs, though, unfortunetaly, during your studying
    you skipped most of the balance trainings.

    You successfully make first several
    leaps and become more confident. But the figure doesn''t seem to loose their
    speed. And yet you don''t let them go too far.

    Now you notice that there''s
    no more roofs ahead. As the figure approaches the end, they leap and make somersault
    as they land. You''re not sure about this, but you must decide immediately!


    You
    can:

    1: Leap and try to make somersault.

    2: Accurately climb down.'
