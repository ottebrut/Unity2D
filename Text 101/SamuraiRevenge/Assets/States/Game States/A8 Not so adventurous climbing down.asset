  m_EditorClassIdentifier: 
  storyText: 'Very carefully you climb down from 4-meters high roof. In the end you
    make one bad movement and landing isn''t so good. But you still can chase, though
    climbing down have seriously slowed you down. And the figure is going further
    and further. You start to loose your hope to capture them. But now you remember
    that there''s one shuriken in your right pocket, which your forgot to return
    yesterday. Maybe on shuriken''s sessions you were more attentive, than on leap
    ones.


    You can:

    1: Continue running.

    2: Shoot your shuriken.'
